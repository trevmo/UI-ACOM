## Background
NASA Ames has a long-standing partnership with the University of Idaho, particularly in their senior design projects. This repo contains work from the 2017-2018 project, entitled "Advanced Communications System for Suborbital Flight."

The project goals were three-fold:
1. Integrate an Iridium 9523 into the communications system.
2. Prototype a Zigbee mesh network for the communications system.
3. Adapt a model of a Tube Deployed Re-Entry Vehicle for housing and safely returning the communications system.

## Repo Contents
### modem-com
This project is an app designed for running on ArchLinux on a Raspberry Pi. It handles serial communications between the Pi, an Iridium 9523 (in an NAL A3LA-RS), and a GPS receiver (GlobalSat BU-353S4). See the project's README for more info.
